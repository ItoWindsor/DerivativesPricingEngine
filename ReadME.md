![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-2C41CB?style=for-the-badge&logo=C%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

# Description
This is a toy but production-grade project designed to dive deep into **modern C++** through the lens of **quantitative finance**.

The goal is to create a **modular and extensible derivatives pricing library**, with support for multiple instruments, models, and pricing engines using modern design patterns like **Composition**, **Dependency Injection**, and the **Factory Pattern**.



## ðŸ§  Goals

- Learn C++ by building something non-trivial  
- Get comfortable with CMake, Conan, and numerical programming in C++  
- Have fun and build a small usable library! 

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItoWindsor/CppLearn.git
   cd CppLearn
   ./build.sh
